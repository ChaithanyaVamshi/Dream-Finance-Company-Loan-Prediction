# Dream-Finance-Company-Loan-Prediction

Dream Housing Finance company deals in all home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customer first apply for home loan after that company validates the customer eligibility for loan. Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, we should identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers.

It is a classification problem where we have to predict whether a loan would be approved or not. Loan prediction is a very common real-life problem that each retail bank faces atleast once in its lifetime. If done correctly, it can save a lot of man hours at the end of a retail bank.

Below are the steps that are performed in this project:

1. Problem Statement

   b) Bivariate Analysis
6. Missing value and outlier treatment
7. Model Building
8. Evaluation Metrics for classification problems
9. Hyper parameter tuning using GridSearchCV
9. Logistic Regression using stratified k-folds cross validation

After applying all the above steps best accuracy received using Logistic Regression is 80.95%
